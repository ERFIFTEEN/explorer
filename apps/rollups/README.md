# Cartesi Rollups

This web application displays information about Dapps generated by Our Cartesi-Dapp-Factory contract. The following are available;

-   Total number of dapps created using the Factory contract
-   Total amount of inputs of all dapps
-   List of all dapps where a filtering can be used
-   A Dapp details page where Epochs, Inputs, Notices, Reports and Vouchers can be checked (We guess the graphQL endpoint to such Dapp, but it can be replaced)

## Running locally

This is a [Next.js v12](https://nextjs.org) based web app that also uses graphQL generated code for querying information.

1. Make sure you ran the `yarn install` in the root folder of this monorepo to guarantee all things are installed and created (symlinks) as expected.
2. Then in this subdirectory you can run `yarn codegen` to generate the graphQL code and then `yarn dev`
3. Open the application in browser and switch your metamask wallet to a supported network i.e. **goerli, Arbitrum Goerli or Polygon Mumbai**.
