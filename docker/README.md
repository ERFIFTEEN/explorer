# Explorer Docker Image

Preconfigured dockerfiles to build images for the following apps:

-   Rollups Explorer ([dockerfile](./Dockerfile-rollups))
-   Staking Explorer (Not available yet)

From this folder `./docker`, you could run the following command:

```sh
docker build -t rollups -f Dockerfile-rollups ../
```

Or from the project's root folder:

```sh
docker build -t rollups -f docker/Dockerfile-rollups .
```

> resulting in a rollups:latest image.

## Docker Compose

The directory also contains a [docker-compose-rollups.yml](./docker-compose-rollups.yml) for reference. Ps: assuming you ran the command above and generated an image called **rollups**

Running the following command, you get your container started.

```sh
docker-compose -f  docker-compose-rollups.yml up
```

### Local development support (Rollups)

In case you want to use your own generated docker rollups explorer and for the application to be able to function correctly, make sure you have the ABI of deployed contracts exported in a simple format like, for example, the one generated by the [`--export`](https://github.com/wighawag/hardhat-deploy#6-hardhat-export) command when using [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/). The explorer rollups expect a file named `localhost.json` to exist per volume mapping. _Check the compose file for reference._
